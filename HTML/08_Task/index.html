                    <p>This project is related to a food menu. When a customer wants to order food they can do so by choosing the day. Every day they have the option of Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. After choosing one option they can see the menu and order food. Once they have placed their order they will receive the total bill and can proceed to pay it.</p>
