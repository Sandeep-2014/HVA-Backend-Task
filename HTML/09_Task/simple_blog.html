                    1) :- Understanding Male Dominance in Indian Society
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Male dominant society is where males hold primary power in all aspects of society, such as politics and family. I agree with the statement ‘Indian society is a male dominant society’. In India males often have more power than women. In every Indian family there is a man who rules over the whole house known as the head. He makes all the decisions for the family and is the sole earner. There are many restrictions for women they can’t make decisions or give their opinions on household matters. However, in some families women can express their views but the final decision lies with the head of the household (man). This shows a big difference in how men and women are treated unfairly. Men have more control over decision-making and opportunities. We can see more discrimination in education, rights, freedom, and gender equality for women. Because of these reasons Indian society is considered a male dominant society.

                    2) :- Why reading news daily is important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In today’s generation everyone have to aware that what happening in our country? for that reading daily news can be the first way to know. By reading daily news we can know what is our government doing, what are the new laws and regulations made by our government for us, and also we can aware of our country politics and also about political parties. Reading news is not only for our government and political parties, when we read news paper we can find job advertisement and if we eligible for that job so we can easily apply for that and also when we read news our vocabulary will be very strong and good. Reading news have their so many advantages so in my opinion everyone have read daily news.

                    3) :- Openai and Elon Musk
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Elon Musk and OpenAI are having a disagreement. Musk wanted more control over OpenAI even suggesting merging it with Tesla and becoming the CEO. But OpenAI didn’t agree because they think it’s important for everyone to have a say not just one person. Musk also accused OpenAI of focusing too much on making money and not enough on their original goal of helping people with artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI says they’re still committed to their mission and have done a lot of good work in different areas like farming and healthcare. Musk’s changing opinions and actions, like leaving OpenAI to start a competing project, have added to the conflict.
